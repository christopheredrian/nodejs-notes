# The V8 Engine



### Who developed the V8 engine?

Google developed the engine, and is free and open-source



### What language is V8 written?

V8 is written in the C++ language



### How does it work?

Your JavaScript code will be parsed by the engine (C++ code) and that engine will be converted into machine language (what the processor can be run)



### Can you extend the V8 engine?

Yes, V8 has hooks which you can add features upon. This will mean that you can extend the JavaScript language as well - essentially this is where Node comes in - bindings of JavaScript to C++ under the hood.
