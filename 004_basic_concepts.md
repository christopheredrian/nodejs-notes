# Basic Concepts

This section will talk all about the V8 JavaScript engine which is used by Chrome and Node to execute JavaScript

## Important Concepts

- Processors - the Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Machine Code -
- C++

#### Processors

The processor or micro-processor is the brain of your computer and it will understand some kind of processor architecture (Instruction code). Those set of instructions are:

- IA-32
- x86-64 
- ARM
- MIPS

### Machine Code

All code (Java, C#, Node) will eventually be compiled into something that the processor can understand which is **machine code**. It is important to note that generally we don't write in the low-level machine code instead we write on higher-level languages such as in modern programming languages: Java, C++, C#, Node, etc.



### C/C++

C and C++ are programming languages that still have control in memory. In comparison with other high-level programming languages such as Java and JavaScript we don't typically deal with memory (it's automatically made for us). 

So what's the importance of C++ in Node? It's because Node is written in C++ (specifically the V8 engine is), which implies that everything that you write in Node will be processed in V8 (C++).
